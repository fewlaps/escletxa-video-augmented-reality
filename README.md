Escletxa is a videostream renderer that shows the streams in a Augmented Reality way. You can turn arround while watching 4 full-powered videostreams, played at the same time.

The first thing you'll see when you install the app, is a customised ZXing QR scanner. You can look for a QR with the answer to life, the universe and everything, or bypass that scan tapping on the top right corner.

The next screen you'll see is the Augmented Reality view. This screen is working with Appunta, the Geodata Representation Framework.

This project has been used at GREC, one of the most important cultural events of Barcelona. The main supporters of the project has been Barcelona Lab Cultural (BLC) and the Culture Department of Barcelona. The project has been developed by Fewlaps, the mobile development company of Barcelona.

Enjoy Escletxa!
